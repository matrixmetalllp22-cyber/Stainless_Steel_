      <p>Key Factors Influencing Price
Automation Level: Fully automatic machines are significantly more expensive than semi-automatic or manual models due to the integrated technology, which increases efficiency and safety.
Material and Thickness: Machines designed for heavy-duty materials like thick gauge steel coils are substantially more expensive than those for light materials like paper or thin films.
Capacity and Speed: Higher production capacity (tons/day) and machine speed (meters/minute or RPM) directly correlate with a higher price point, as they involve more robust components and powerful drive systems.
Brand and Quality: Reputable manufacturers using high-quality, durable components generally have higher prices, but often offer better longevity, reliability, and support.
Condition (New vs. Used): Prices listed above are for new machines. Used machines can be cheaper initially, but may require additional investment in rebuilding or upgrades.
Additional Features: Features like PLC control, integrated web guides, different cutting systems (razor, crush, shear), and safety interlocks can add to the overall.</p>,
    philosophy:
     <p>We combine Japanese & Indian manufacturing excellence with a focus on continuous improvement, operational discipline, and long-term partnerships.</p>,
    values:
      <p>Quality, Safety, Integrity, Customer Focus, Sustainability — embedded in all processes and decisions.</p>,
